In this tutorial, dpMD is applied to [Lysozyme](https://www.rcsb.org/structure/3LZT), a classical example.
dpMD was implemented to extract the best of two worlds: [CHARMM](https://www.charmm.org/) is used for normal mode calculations and file processing, while [NAMD](http://www.ks.uiuc.edu/Research/namd/) is used as MD engine. Therefore, **both programs must be installed**.
All necessary [inputs](https://github.com/antonielgomes/dpMD/tree/main/tutorial/inputs) and [scripts](https://github.com/antonielgomes/dpMD/tree/main/tutorial/scripts) files can be downloaded for performing dpMD locally.

### System files
Before performing dpMD, the following input files for CHARMM and NAMD are required:
- NAMD equilibrated files:
  - Coordinates: `step6.coor` and `step6.pdb` (the last one can be generated with [CHARMM](https://www.charmm.org/) or [VMD](https://www.ks.uiuc.edu/Research/vmd/))
  - Velocities: `step6.vel`
  - Cell dimensions: `step6.xsc`
  - system:
- CHARMM parameter files:
  - Paramater files: `step1.psf` for the protein and `step3.psf` for the system
  - Stream file: `step3.str`
  - Crystal images: `crystal_image.str`
 - Topology files:
  -  The `toppar.str` stream file reads all topology files inside the [toppar](https://github.com/antonielgomes/dpMD/tree/main/tutorial/toppar/) directory.

All these files can be generate using the [CHARMM-GUI](https://www.charmm-gui.org/) server.

### Normal mode calculations
As dpMD uses normal modes (NMs) to obtain large conformational exploration, they must be calculated and provided as `mass-weighted` coordinate files. Although NMs can be calculated by several tools, this tutorial uses [CHARMM](https://www.charmm.org/), which minimizes the equilibrated protein in vacuum and then calculates NMs. These files are already available inside the [modes](https://github.com/antonielgomes/dpMD/tree/main/tutorial/modes) directory.
The minimized structure are available in crd and pdb files, filling the b-factor column with NM fluctuations in angstrom (`minimized-angstrom`), as a magnitude vector (`minimized-b-factor`) and as b-factor (`minimized-vector-magnitude`). The `modes.mod` contains all calculated NMs.

This protocol provides [scripts](https://github.com/antonielgomes/dpMD/tree/main/tutorial/scripts) for performing NM calculations.
The first 194 low-frequeny NMs can be by running the following command:
```
charmm -i scripts/normal-modes.inp
```
Following, NMs can be written as coordinates vectors or trajectories. Here, only the first 14 low-frequency NMs will be generated:
```
charmm -i scripts/normal-modes-dcd-crd.inp nmodes=14
```
### Normal mode combinations
To obtain uniformly combined set of NM vectors, the input files `input-modes.txt` - containing the uniformly distributed set of vectors obtained from [PDIM](https://github.com/antonielgomes/dpMD/tree/main/PDIM) - and `list-modes.txt` - containing the NM numbers will be provided. Both are available into the [scripts](https://github.com/antonielgomes/dpMD/tree/main/tutorial/scripts) directory.
In this tutorial, six combinations (`ncomb`, number of vectors) will be generated, while it will be read only the first 14 low-frequency NMs (`nmodes`).
```
charmm -i scripts/normal-mode-combination.inp ncomb=6 nmodes=14 inputfile=./inputs/input-modes.txt listmodes=./inputs/list-modes.txt 
```

### Generating structures along combined normal modes with VMOD
In this step, the vacuum minimized structure will be displaced along all uniformly combined NM vectors using the `vmod.inp` script, located into the [scripts](https://github.com/antonielgomes/dpMD/tree/main/tutorial/scripts) directory. This step can be done automatically by running `vmod.sh` script in bash:
```
bash scripts/vmod.sh
```

**dpMD**

In this step, the equlibrated system will be driven towards all conformations generated by **VMOD**.

Initially, each conformation will be set as a target in the PDB format using `charmm`. In this example, six replicas were set in `nreps`:
```
charmm -i scripts/target.inp nreps=6
```
Following, TMD will be performed using `namd`:
```
bash scripts/tmd-namd.sh
```

```
charmm -i scripts/restraints.inp nreps=6
```

```
bash scripts/tmd-equil-namd.sh
```

```
bash scripts/tmd-free-md-namd.sh
```


### Bonus: **MDeNM**
```
scripts/mdenm-namd-exc.sh
```

```
scripts/mdenm-namd-md.sh
```
