# PDIM

**PDIM** (**P**oints in N **DIM**ensions) is a minimization script that distibutes P points in the surface of an N-sphere.

### Code availability
**PDIM** is written in `Python` and uses libraries, such as `numpy` and `scipy` for calculations. However **PDIM** is also available in a compiled version for [Linux](https://google.com) and [Windows](https://google.com).

calculate `normal modes`
```
charmm -i scripts/normal-modes.inp
```


generate crd and dcd of modes:
```
charmm -i scripts/normal-modes-dcd-crd.inp nmodes=20
```

generating normal mode combination
```
bash scripts/mdenm-modes-combination.sh
```

combine normal modes

**VMOD**
```
scripts/runvmod-comb.sh = run vmod to obtain displaced conformations
```

**dpMD**

In this step, the equlibrated system will be driven towards all conformations generated by **VMOD**.

Initially, each conformation will be set as a target in the PDB format using `charmm`. In this example, six replicas were set in `nreps`:
```
charmm -i scripts/target.inp nreps=6
```
Following, TMD will be performed using `namd`:
```
bash scripts/tmd-namd.sh
```

```
charmm -i scripts/restraints.inp nreps=6
```

```
bash scripts/tmd-equil-namd.sh
```

```
bash scripts/tmd-free-md-namd.sh
```
