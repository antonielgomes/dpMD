# PDIM

**PDIM** (**P**oints in **DIM**ensions) is a minimization script that distibutes N points on the surface of a D-dimensional unit-sphere according to an energetic potential of repulsion function E.

In other words, normalized vectors (radius = 1) are randomly distributed in a unit-sphere, then minimized to generate a uniform distribution.

This script was devised to boost `protein conformational changes` using normal modes. We mapped the `normal mode space` into an `Euclidean space` for a **rational** normal mode combination and protein conformational exploration.

Normal mode combined vectors separated by 1 Å from 2 to 8 dimensions (1.05 Å in 3 dimensions) can be accessed in the [points](https://github.com/antonielgomes/dpMD/tree/main/PDIM/points) directory.
These values can be used as weights for combining vectors in `orthogonal spaces`.

### Code availability
**PDIM** is written in `Python` and uses `numpy` and `scipy` libraries for calculations. The code is free ([PDIM.py](https://github.com/antonielgomes/dpMD/blob/main/PDIM/PDIM.py))for anyone who is interested to optimize it according to their own needs. However, a standalone executable is available for [Linux](https://google.com) and [Windows](https://google.com).

```

**dpMD**

In this step, the equlibrated system will be driven towards all conformations generated by **VMOD**.

Initially, each conformation will be set as a target in the PDB format using `charmm`. In this example, six replicas were set in `nreps`:
```
charmm -i scripts/target.inp nreps=6
```
Following, TMD will be performed using `namd`:
```
bash scripts/tmd-namd.sh
```

```
charmm -i scripts/restraints.inp nreps=6
```

```
bash scripts/tmd-equil-namd.sh
```

```
bash scripts/tmd-free-md-namd.sh
```
