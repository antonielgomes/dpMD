# distributed-points Molecular Dynamics

`distributed-points Molecular Dynamics` (dpMD) is an enhanced-sampling approach that allows a large protein conformational sampling based on `normal mode` (NM) vectors. dpMD generates harmonically restrained structures along NM vectors that are further relaxed with standard MD simulations to fill the conformational space.

NM-driven enhanced-sampling methods highly deppend on the set of NM vectors. To guarantee an optional protein conformational sampling with dpMD, we employed a `uniformly distributed NM vectors`, generated by a minimization script developed by our team called [PDIM](https://github.com/antonielgomes/dpMD/tree/main/PDIM).

### How dpMD works?
Before performing conformational samping with dpMD, a `preparation` step is ncessary. Firstly, the protein of interest must be subjected to an `equilibration` step. Following, the protein is, if needed, properly minimized (in this case) for further `NM calculations`. Then, uniformly distributed vectors obtained from [PDIM](https://github.com/antonielgomes/dpMD/tree/main/PDIM) are used as weights for a `uniform NM combination` of the most relevant (usually low-frequency) modes.
Once all these information are ready, dpMD is be performed in three stages:

- First stage: the same (vacuum minimized) structure used in NM calculations is subjected to a series of positional restraints potentials to generate structures properly distributed along NM vectors using [VMOD](https://doi.org/10.1016/0010-4655(95)00052-H).
- Second stage: [Targeted Molecular Dynamics (TMD)](https://doi.org/10.1080/08927029308022170) simulations are conducted for the solvated system, driving the protein towards those structures obtained in the first stage.
- Third stage: all solvated conformations obtained in the preciding stage are further equilibrated and submitted to standard MD simulations to obtain an equilibrated unbiased conformational ensemble.

The conformational ensemble obtained in the third stage corresponds to the conformational exploration performed by dpMD, in which can provide structural, dynamicas and functional aspects of the studied protein.

### Why using dpMD?

The imposed positional restraints along uniformly combined NM vectors followed by standard MD simulations performed by dpMD allows generatining an extensive conformational exploration, outperforming the powerful enhanced-sampling method developed by our team called [MDeNM](https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.jctc.5b00003). Therefore, dpMD is a promising alternative for conducting protein conformational sampling, providing valuable contributions in the field, such as:
- Rational protein conformational sampling.
- Systematic exploration of the NM space.
- Coverage of experimental structures.
- Identification of enegertically favorable regions in the conformational space.
- Insights into dynamical and functional aspects of proteins.

In addition, dpMD can be adapted to `any NM vectors` obtained from other techniques or even from `Principal Component Analysis (PCA)` obtained by standard MD simulations or experimental conformations.
