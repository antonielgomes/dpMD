# distributed-points Molecular Dynamics

`distributed-points Molecular Dynamics` (dpMD) is an enhanced-sampling approach that allows a large protein conformational sampling based on `normal mode` (NM) vectors. dpMD generates harmonically restrained structures along NM vectors that are further relaxed with standard MD simulations to fill the conformational space efficiently.

Considering the interest
A notable novelty of dpMD is the use of a uniform set of vectors, obtained by 
To date, protein conformational exploration Altogether, these pieces of evidence show that an optimal strategy to produce and select linear combinations of NMs would be of great value in the context of enhanced sampling strategies. Further, there is still a need to understand how wholly and extensively the subspace described by low-frequency NMs is being explored. The present work addresses these points by presenting a minimization algorithm yielding an optimal distribution for the orientations of a set of NM combined vectors used for generating protein conformations to be subsequently submitted to standard MD for efficient protein conformational sampling.
The main novelty of dpMD is uniformly distributed vectors

dpMD is composed of three stages:

### Why using dpMD?
The imposed positional restraints along uniformly combined NM vectors allows extensive conformational sampling of proteins, outperforming the powerful enhanced-sampling method developed by our team called [MDeNM](https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.jctc.5b00003). Therefore, dpMD is a promising alternative for conducting protein conformational sampling, providing valuable contributions in the field, such as:
- Rational protein conformational sampling.
- Systematic exploration of the NM space.
- Coverage of experimental structures.
- Identification of enegertically favorable regions in the conformational space.
- Insights into dynamical and functional aspects of proteins.

dpMD can be adapted to `any NM vectors` obtained from other techniques or even from `Principal Component Analysis (PCA)` obtained by standard MD simulations or experimental conformations.

In this step, the equlibrated system will be driven towards all conformations generated by **VMOD**.

Initially, each conformation will be set as a target in the PDB format using `charmm`. In this example, six replicas were set in `nreps`:
```
charmm -i scripts/target.inp nreps=6
```
Following, TMD will be performed using `namd`:
```
bash scripts/tmd-namd.sh
```

```
charmm -i scripts/restraints.inp nreps=6
