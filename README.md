# distributed-points Molecular Dynamics

`distributed-points Molecular Dynamics` (dpMD) is an enhanced-sampling approach that allows a large protein conformational sampling based on `normal mode` (NM) vectors. dpMD generates harmonically restrained structures along NM vectors that are further relaxed with standard MD simulations to fill the conformational space.

NM-driven enhanced-sampling methods highly deppend on the set of NM vectors. To guarantee an optional protein conformational sampling with dpMD, we employed a `uniformly distributed NM vectors`, generated by a minimization script developed by our team called [PDIM](https://github.com/antonielgomes/dpMD/tree/main/PDIM).

### Why using dpMD?
The imposed positional restraints along uniformly combined NM vectors allows extensive conformational sampling of proteins, outperforming the powerful enhanced-sampling method developed by our team called [MDeNM](https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.jctc.5b00003). Therefore, dpMD is a promising alternative for conducting protein conformational sampling, providing valuable contributions in the field, such as:
- Rational protein conformational sampling.
- Systematic exploration of the NM space.
- Coverage of experimental structures.
- Identification of enegertically favorable regions in the conformational space.
- Insights into dynamical and functional aspects of proteins.

dpMD can be adapted to `any NM vectors` obtained from other techniques or even from `Principal Component Analysis (PCA)` obtained by standard MD simulations or experimental conformations.

### How dpMD works?

dpMD is composed of three stages:

**dpMD**

In this step, the equlibrated system will be driven towards all conformations generated by **VMOD**.

Initially, each conformation will be set as a target in the PDB format using `charmm`. In this example, six replicas were set in `nreps`:
```
charmm -i scripts/target.inp nreps=6
```
Following, TMD will be performed using `namd`:
```
bash scripts/tmd-namd.sh
```

```
charmm -i scripts/restraints.inp nreps=6
```

```
bash scripts/tmd-equil-namd.sh
```

```
bash scripts/tmd-free-md-namd.sh
